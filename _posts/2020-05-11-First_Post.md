After a few failed attempts, I've managed to successfully post a website to GitHub that isn't just un-styled html! That's pretty cool, and this test post will probably be useful as a tool to see if the website is being generated properly.

I'm using Jekyll, a ruby-based static website generator. Alongside this tool, I'm using the minimal-mistakes theme developed for Jekyll.

Eventually, I plan to fill out the rest of this website, so that it functions as a useful portfolio.
